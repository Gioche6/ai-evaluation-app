            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The AI Evaluation System is designed to assess AI systems based on various ethical, transparency, and fairness criteria. This comprehensive framework evaluates AI systems across six key metrics: Bias Detection and Mitigation, Explainability and Transparency, Ethical Guidelines, Socio-Cultural Relevance, Governance and Accountability, and Continuous Monitoring and Evaluation. By providing a structured evaluation process, the system aims to ensure that AI technologies are developed and deployed responsibly.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Context</h2>
            <p>In today's world, AI systems are increasingly integrated into various aspects of society, from healthcare to finance and beyond. However, the rapid adoption of AI technologies has raised significant concerns regarding their ethical implications, fairness, and transparency. To address these concerns, it is essential to establish robust evaluation frameworks that can guide the development and deployment of AI systems in a manner that respects human rights and promotes social good.</p>
            <p>This project is particularly focused on creating an AI explainability framework for assessing AI systems in Africa. Given the diverse socio-cultural contexts and unique challenges present in African countries, it is crucial to develop tailored evaluation metrics that address these specific needs. The AI Evaluation System is designed to bridge this gap, providing a comprehensive tool that can help ensure AI systems are not only effective but also ethical and inclusive.</p>

            <h2>How to Use the System</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Access the Evaluation Form:</strong> Navigate to the <a href="/form">Evaluation Form</a> page to begin the assessment process.</li>
                <li><strong>Fill in the Details:</strong> Provide the necessary information about the AI system being evaluated, including the title and scores for each criterion within the six metrics.</li>
                <li><strong>Submit the Form:</strong> Once all details are filled in, click the "Calculate" button to submit the form and view the evaluation results.</li>
                <li><strong>View the Summary:</strong> After submission, the system will display a summary of the evaluation, including a radar chart and overall scores.</li>
                <li><strong>Explore Other Results:</strong> To view previous evaluations, navigate to the <a href="/results">Results</a> page. The dashboard can be accessed via the <a href="/dashboard">Dashboard</a> page to see aggregate data and visualizations.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h2>Interpreting the Results</h2>
            <p>The evaluation results are presented in both tabular and graphical formats to provide a comprehensive overview of the AI system's performance across the six key metrics. Each metric is scored on a scale from 1 to 5, with detailed descriptions provided for each score. The radar chart visualizes these scores, allowing for easy comparison across different metrics. The overall score is an average of all the metric scores, providing a single measure of the AI system's performance.</p>
            <h3>Score Descriptions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1:</strong> Poor performance, indicating significant issues that need to be addressed.</li>
                <li><strong>2:</strong> Minimal performance, with substantial gaps and areas for improvement.</li>
                <li><strong>3:</strong> Moderate performance, with some issues but generally acceptable.</li>
                <li><strong>4:</strong> Good performance, with minor issues that can be improved upon.</li>
                <li><strong>5:</strong> Excellent performance, meeting or exceeding expectations comprehensively.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Based on the scores and overall evaluation, recommendations can be made to improve the AI system in specific areas where it may be lacking.</p>

            <h2>Benefits and Expected Impact</h2>
            <p>The AI Evaluation System aims to have a significant impact on the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies, particularly in Africa. Some key benefits include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Promoting Ethical AI:</strong> By evaluating AI systems against rigorous ethical standards, the system helps ensure that AI technologies are developed and used in ways that respect human rights and societal values.</li>
                <li><strong>Enhancing Transparency:</strong> The system's focus on explainability and transparency helps demystify AI decision-making processes, making it easier for stakeholders to understand how AI systems work and make decisions.</li>
                <li><strong>Mitigating Bias:</strong> By identifying and addressing biases in AI systems, the evaluation framework helps promote fairness and inclusivity, ensuring that AI technologies benefit all segments of society.</li>
                <li><strong>Supporting Informed Decision-Making:</strong> The comprehensive evaluation results provide valuable insights that can guide policymakers, developers, and other stakeholders in making informed decisions about AI deployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The project is expected to contribute significantly to the discourse on AI ethics and governance, particularly in the African context. By providing a tailored evaluation framework, the AI Evaluation System aims to address the unique challenges and opportunities presented by AI technologies in Africa, promoting their responsible and beneficial use.</p>
